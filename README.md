# AWS in a Month of Lunches
This is a repository of Terraform code created as a result of having gone through AWS in a Month of Lunches by David Clinton (Originally published: August 18, 2017).
Once you go into the `chapters` folder, you'll see I've divvied up the lessons by chapter. For sake of simplicity and speed, I've kept the code flat as opposed to modular (different folders for different resources).

## Chapters
1. (Before You Begin)
2. EC2 Web Server
3. More Robust EC2 Website
4. Databases on AWS
5. DNS
6. S3


## Resources Created

## Instructions
